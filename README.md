#Speechblocks Prototyping Font
This is a font for prototyping with Speechblocks. You can use it in Keynote, Sketch, Illustrator, etc.

## Demo
[Check out the demo here](https://github.mit.edu/pages/jnazare/speechblocks-prototyping-font/)
Note: If its easier, you can screenshot the Speechblocks here and then put them into prototyping applications.

## Installation

### Mac Instructions
* Open up speechblocks-font > fonts
* Right click on the speechblocks.tff and click "Open With" > "Font Book"
* In the bottom right hand corner of the Font Book screen, click install

## Notes
* You can type with both upper and lowercase letters, but only uppercase ones will appear on the screen.
* Punctuations and numbers can be used, they just won't be in the SpeechBlocks font. Instead, they will be in the default font for the document.
* The font is actually in black, and a small amount of jQuery (in colors.js) is used to alter the colors on the screen. This is because we wanted a font that is typeable (not emoticons), and we cannot make a colored font that works across different applications.
* The letters are not actually white, they are transparent (and so will appear white on a white background).
* In computer applications (keynote, illustrator, etc.) you will have to change the color of the font manually (see reference hex colors). But hopefully it will still be faster to prototype with the font instead of individual images :)

## To Do
* Add in white lettering on demo (currently, the letters themselves have no color, but are just shown on their backdrop)
* Add in export (as svg or png) to the demo

## Reference HEX Colors
* Blue: #1578FC
* Red: #FD201C

Please let me know if you have any issues installing the font :)
