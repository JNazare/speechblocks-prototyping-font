			<ol>
				<li> Open up speechblocks-font > fonts </li>
				<li> Right click on the speechblocks.tff and click "Open With" > "Font Book" </li>
				<li> In the bottom right hand corner of the Font Book screen, click install </li>
			</ol>

			<strong class="sb-text" > Notes </strong> 
			<br>
			<ul>
				<li> You can type with both upper and lowercase letters, but only uppercase ones will appear on the screen. </li>
				<li> Punctuations and numbers can be used, they just won't be in the SpeechBlocks font. Instead, they will be in the default font for the document. </li>
				<li> The font is actually in black and white, and a small amount of jQuery (in colors.js) is used to alter the colors on the screen. This is because we wanted a font that is typeable (not emoticons), and we cannot make a colored font that works across different applications.</li>
				<li> In computer applications (keynote, illustrator, etc.) you will have to change the color of the font manually (see reference hex colors). But hopefully it will still be faster to prototype with the font instead of individual images :)
			</ul>
